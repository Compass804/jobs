Organization & Mission
Founded in 2005, Compass Working Capital (“Compass”) is a nonprofit organization that supports low-income families to build assets and financial capabilities as a pathway out of poverty. More broadly, Compass seeks to build a leading, nonprofit financial services organization that promotes economic mobility and financial security for low-income families by influencing field-related practice and policy.

Over the last seven years, our focus has been the launch and expansion of an innovative, new model for the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, a historically underutilized employment and savings program for families who live in federally subsidized housing. The first program of its kind in the country, the Compass FSS program is offered through partnerships with multiple housing partners in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. 
Building on the success of our local programs in New England, Compass launched a national network in 2016 to help expand the scope and impact of the FSS program around the country. Through this network, Compass provides training and technical assistance to mission aligned housing partners who seek to implement the Compass FSS model in their own communities. The Compass FSS program continues to attract local and national attention as an innovative model that supports low-income families to build assets, achieve their goals, and make progress toward financial security. 
In addition to our flagship FSS programs, we also provide contract-based financial coaching programs for other organizations that serve low-income families.
